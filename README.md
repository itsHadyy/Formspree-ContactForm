That's it, your form already works! It will post the form onto an external domain, formspree.io, and send you an email with all the form content. No database. And you can just hit reply in your mailbox to continue the conversation with your visitor.

Setting it up is easy and free. Here's how:

Submit the form and confirm your email address
Go to your website and submit the form once. This will send you an email asking to confirm your email address, so that no one can start sending you spam from random websites.
